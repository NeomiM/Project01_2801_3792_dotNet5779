 1 V what is a struct
2 how to do global enums and add to a class
3 add what to do if id is wrong/ not in the right format
5 V add a toString for the tester class
6 think of more properties for tester and trainee: picture, how many stars, option to write review
7 V configureation: make global firstTestID for the first test number
8 add to every property the proper checks
                //check if it's all numbers- 8/9 numbers
                //check for letters,and ammount of numbers in the id

 DAL
 1 how to get the lists from DS->DataSource.cs
 2 implement the functions in Dal_imp
 3 add check for id if exist
 4 V make "printer number" for testId from usercontrol (automatially updates number from the first number in configuration in BE)
 5 make uopdates for people and test
 DS
 make netunim for when the program starts
  

 Questions:
 1 how poublic/private should the classes be?
 2 is there a function that gets the list of people? (DAL)
 3 what directios are the projects for references?
 4 is it enough to just add a mishtneh of a person or to use params[] or deteils
